        <h1>The Role</h1>
        <p>The project was assigned to our group in the month of May 2020 with a timeline of 
          a fortnight. We all were well aware of our strengths and promptly prioritized our tasks, while creating a project brief explaining each team members role. 
          Working as an Interaction designer. Along side with my team members Ally and
          Mikella I was also responsible for user research, interaction design, proto-typing and user testing.</p>

      <h1>The Analysis</h1>
      <dl>
        <dt>I want to feel more involved.</dt>
        <dd>Ability to see the difference being brought through our donation and volunteering 
          in the community gives a relief to some users and feel greater attachment towards
          the foundation and its people cause.</dd>
          <dt>No trust in charity organizations.</dt>
          <dd>Most users feel after they have donated to a charity they have no clue about their 
            donation and how its been put to better use for a cause. Which means giving more 
            transparency to users about donation step by step process which will show the where-
            bouts of the donation will give the user more control and gain trust in return.</dd>
          <dt>A need for Convenience and simplicity.</dt>
          <dd>Many users aren't either of the above these individuals would prefer the convenience
            of easy donation a quick and simple way to feel being part of a cause.  
            Fewer steps to accomplish their goals.</dd>

      <h1>The Insight</h1>
      <p>Primary research uncovered that users are looking for ease of use, to feel being a part 
        of the community with greater transparency, and reveal this would be considering 
        getting involved with a not for profit organization. 
        Summarizing as every user has a different way of interacting with a particular 
        organization. Some individuals use a straight forward way to be involved  some would 
        prefer to feel further indulged in the organizations causes and see through the process.
        This helped our team to march forward into creating a persona and journey.

        <h1>The Solution</h1>
        <p>We believe that offering a platform that’s simple to use, connects closely with its users and transparent with its operations would better attract interested individuals who are keen on helping out with the cause by increasing trust and engagement levels with users</p>

      <h1>The Information Architect</h1>
      <p>Before starting up on our design process we studied the user flow and app and websites architecture to absorb the gaps in its existing content. 
        Our new flow and site map categorized and labelled content based on what users expected and created a simplistic navigation.
